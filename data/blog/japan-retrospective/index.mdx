### Intro

This is going to be a little different from the posts I typically make on this site!

During my senior year of high school, I was given the behemoth task of planning a trip to Japan for my immediate family of four. The idea was my Mom's——I was given absolutely nothing to work with, except for the general time interval which was feasible (the summer of 2023) alongside the guttural desire to go. Although I happily obliged——I was the most "knowledgeable" about internet research and Japanese culture——I quickly realized that being the one to plan came with both responsibilities and accountability. I would be the one to:

-   Plan the entire itinerary, from start to finish (which stipulated deciding on the cities we'd visit, the attractions we'd see, and the general pathing between them)
-   Book all flights, accommodations (hotels, ryokans/inns, etc.), and transportation (shinkansen/bullet trains, buses, subways, etc.)
-   Be the primary navigator, a.k.a. figuring out how the public transportation system works as a suburban Angeleno who had never taken a bus (let alone the subway) in his life

Although I was blatantly overwhelmed, the overall excitement which came with the idea of the trip itself was enough to keep me going. For the next few months, I spent many days and nights dealing with the planning process, and I can say with confidence that it was one of the most rewarding experiences of my life. I'd like to share some of the highlights, blunders, and experiences I gathered throughout the process.

## Fundamentals

Before getting into the nitty-gritty of the itinerary and planning process, I'll cover some of the fundamental aspects of traveling to Japan, as a prerequisite knowledge floor for terminology, cities, and transportation absolutely exists. Of course, I'll assume that you know of the country's existence alongside its general culture:

1. Japan has a bullet train system called the [Shinkansen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinkansen), which connects many of its major cities together at insanely high speeds. The Shinkansen, alongside many other trains, are owned by a central authority called the [Japan Railways Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan_Railways_Group) (JR). Although you could purchase one-way tickets for JR-owned rail, it's recommended you purchase a [JR Pass](https://japanrailpass.net/en/) _if and only if_ you take the Shinkansen a lot. The JR Pass allows unlimited, economic travel on JR rail (e.g. Shinkansen) for the duration of the pass (offered in 7, 14, and 21-day varieties). The JR Pass is only available to tourists and must be purchased before you arrive in Japan. For reference, here's a map of the Shinkansen network:

2. Within metropolitan areas, you can and should use rechargeable public transportation cards called [IC Cards](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2359_003.html) (e.g. Suica/Pasmo in Tokyo, Icoca in the Kansai region) to utilize subways, trains, buses, and even purchase items at convenience stores. You can top up the balance of these cards at every station, and you can even check its balance with NFC-based phone apps! Here is a map of IC card coverage across Japan; note that all are compatible with each other, except in very rare cases:

</figure>

3. There are many forms of accommodation in Japan. Although there is the typical Western-style hotel from big-name chains, you can experience traditional Japanese hospitality and culture by staying at a [ryokan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryokan) (a traditional Japanese inn) or a [minshuku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minshuku) (a Japanese bed and breakfast).
4. Although [Tokyo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo), [Kyoto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyoto) and [Osaka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osaka) are the most popular cities to visit (and obviously for good reason), we also choose to book accommodation in [Hakone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hakone). It's less known than the three aforementioned cities, but still insanely popular and built for tourists. I'll explain why later!

## The Itinerary

Itinerary-making for a destination like Japan would be described as, at best, a clusterfuck. The moment you Googled ["2-week japan itinerary"](https://www.google.com/search?q=2-week+japan+itinerary) you get back a bunch of self-proclaimed travel warlords who sell you surface-level bullet points and mediocre locations. You can see for yourself how plans can change drastically over time; I kept a Google Doc throughout the entire process:

![Bullshit Bullet Points](/static/images/japan-retrospective/bullshit.png)

Amidst all of this noise, I found a couple of credible and consistent sources which, although were still overwhelming, provided some semblance of "I know what I'm doing, I'm not going to be a stupid tourist." Those were:

-   [japan-guide.com](https://www.japan-guide.com/): Seriously phenomenal itineraries. A lot of my day trips and main destinations were suggested by this site!
-   [r/JapanTravel](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/): I read through dozens of "Itinerary Check" (a user sends in their itinerary, and it gets reviewed by others to see what's feasible, things to change, recommendations, etc.) and "Trip Report" (a user sends in their specific experiences and recommendations) posts. Although you still have to use some internet fluency to discern what's good advice and what's not, I found some lovely ideas here, and decided to add them to our own itinerary based on vibes and family preferences.
-   Friends! Please ask people who've been (or who live there) for recommendations. I ended up skipping some of the places shilled by the internet because of personal anecdotes from friends.

Since the itinerary-making process was super iterative and went through multiple revisions, I'll only be showing the final product here. This was the final pathing that we decided on:

![Main Map](/static/images/japan-retrospective/main-map.png)

The colors of the lines themselves are slightly for show (they're the colors used for transit lines and should be ignored), but each roman numeral here represents a particular city. We can create a calendar to see how our time would be designated across these cities:

![Calendar](/static/images/japan-retrospective/calendar.png)

A lot of thought was put into this particular order and spacing, but I'll only provide a high-level overview here for brevity's sake:

-   Lodging in Kyoto immediately after landing in Kansai International (KIX) facilitates "day trips" (lodging in one location but spending the entire day in another) to Osaka and [Nara](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nara_(city)>), which are both feasible and recommended. As such, we won't need to book additional accommodations nor carry our luggage around in these cities.
-   No backtracking! A lot of itineraries make you land at Haneda Airport in Tokyo, explore Tokyo a couple days, go way west to the Kansai region, and then make you wrap all the way back. That's a lot of Shinkansen money (forcing you to buy JR passes) and carrying around luggage. If you end up splurging in Tokyo at the very beginning, you'd have to either carry that around the entire trip, do [Takuhaibin](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2278.html) (luggage forwarding) which is a hassle, or rent out a coin locker, also a hassle. My routing only makes you take the Shinkansen _a single time_, from Kyoto Station to Odawara Station.
-   Hakone is known for its ryokans and [onsen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onsen), which are relaxing segues between the insane juxtapositions of Kyoto and Tokyo. I chose to do two nights here so that we could take the entire Hakone loop whilst enjoying the in-room dinner services that ryokans provide.
-   Saving Tokyo for last prevents burnout; it's an endless metropolis with many venues for shopping and exploration. Since we'd be buying the most things in Tokyo (courtesy of the weak JPY) we could just box it up and check it out at the airport.

For accommodations, I chose them strategically based on location——for example, they needed to be within walking distance of a bus stop or major train station:

-   In Kyoto, I chose an apartment-style accommodation that sat right atop the [Karasuma Line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karasuma_Line) and was a 10-minute walk from [Shijō Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shij%C5%8D_Station). I opted for an apartment-style accommodation because we would be staying there the longest and would need to do laundry.
-   In Hakone, I chose a ryokan that was a 5-minute walk to [Hakone-Yumoto Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hakone-Yumoto_Station).
-   In Tokyo, I chose a Western-style hotel that was walking distance to the east entrance of [Shinjuku Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinjuku_Station) and was sat right in the middle of [Kabukichō](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabukich%C5%8D). Shinjuku Station is the busiest train station in the world, and would evidently be connected to almost every major attraction in Tokyo.

Finally, for the actual attractions themselves, I kept a [Wanderlog](https://wanderlog.com/), which is a tool specifically designed for travel planning:

![Wanderlog](/static/images/japan-retrospective/wanderlog.png)

With all of this in mind, we finalized our bookings and were ready to go! I'll be covering in detail all of our individual experiences.

## Daily Log

Let's first introduce our four travelers:

Since I'll of course be redacting me and my family's faces, at least these cute little avatars will give you an idea of who's who in the frame!

### Day 0: Blunder Dominos

![Day 0 Map 1](/static/images/japan-retrospective/day-0-map-1.png)

![Day 0 Map 2](/static/images/japan-retrospective/day-0-map-2.png)

Upon arriving in Japan, my first blunder of the trip was not actually researching how to get *out* of the airport. After clearing customs and navigating the airport, we eventually stumbled upon a JR ticket office. I was reluctant to enter at first; I assumed that they only sold JR passes. However, my parents, more optimistic, just wanted to enter to ask for directions and assistance inside. Turns out, they had everything we needed to get out of the airport: the aforementioned IC cards, and a one-way train ticket out of the airport:

<figure>

    />

    </figcaption>
</figure>

In the ticket office we purchased the ["ICOCA & Haruka"](https://web.archive.org/web/20230713044404/https://www.westjr.co.jp/global/en/ticket/icoca-haruka/) discount ticket package (sadly discontinued since September 2023), which comes with the ICOCA IC Card (served in JR West jurisdiction) preloaded with ¥500 alongside a discounted one-way ticket for the [Haruka Limited Express](https://www.westjr.co.jp/global/en/travel/shopping/access/train.html). We learned that the Haruka is the only rail service between KIX and Kyoto Station, and it comes at 30-minute intervals.

In our rush to catch the next Haruka train, which we learned was departing in just three minutes, we hurried to the platform, only to face an unfamiliar barrier... the fare gate:

![Ticket Gate](/static/images/japan-retrospective/ticket-gate.png)

Getting through this fare gate is supposed to be *extremely* easy; you just slip the ticket into the slot and it pops out the other side for retrieval. What you're **NOT** supposed to do (and we were explicitly warned **NOT TO DO THIS** by the ticket office) is tap your IC card on the reader to open the gate, as then your IC card would effectively be charged the full price of the Haruka ticket (we bought a physical, reduced-fare ticket as an alternative to the full-priced trip). Guess what we ended up doing in a panic?

Of course, we realized our mistake on the train ride after we settled in our seats. This is where our next, arguably worse blunder comes in: we didn't know about the "tap-in, tap-out" system which Japanese public transportation uses.

Whenever you tap your IC card to enter a station, it doesn't actually get charged——you're just setting your "start point" for a newly created "trip" in the IC system, and your charge only gets calculated/processed after you go through a tap-out gate at your destination station, effectively ending your trip. We didn't know this at all, so we just assumed that we already got charged, and that we could attempt to refund the unused one-way tickets later.

At Kyoto Station, Google Maps was telling us to transfer to the Karasuma Line. The correct way to do this (that we obviously didn't do) would be to:

- Finish the Haruka trip by tapping out
  - Technically this wouldn't even work regardless of what we did. We can't slip our ticket into the exit fare gate because we didn't start the trip with it, and we couldn't tap out with an IC card because it'd attempt to charge us the full ¥2,850 Haruka ticket on our ¥500 balance.
- Tap in with the IC card to the Karasuma Line
- Tap out at the destination station

Here is the "What Should Have Happened" diagram to help illustrate this:

![What Should Have Happened](/static/images/japan-retrospective/what-should-have-happened.png)

I thought it genuinely could not get any worse, but then we somehow mystically managed to *completely dodge* the tap-out gate at Kyoto Station and ended up at the tap-in gate to the Karasuma line platforms. Of course, since the system never detected us ending our initial trip from KIX, it denied us with an embarrassingly loud blare accompanied with appropriately flashing red lights. When we attempted to exit Kyoto Station entirely, we also got denied at the exit gate because the system was trying to charge ¥2,850 on our ¥500 balance (the full fare of the Haruka ticket).

In a desperate attempt to resolve the situation, we approached a station attendant. The language barrier only worsened our confusion (and frustration), as the attendant struggled to understand exactly what happened even after looking at our IC card balances. We showed our unused Haruka tickets, hoping perhaps for a refund or an explanation. Instead, the attendant inexplicably took our Haruka tickets (which we intended to refund) and waived us out of the station. At this point, we were completely dumbfounded; we thought that we double charged ourselves for the Haruka fare, and that we were now out of ¥2,850 each person.

This simply wasn't the case, however. After a while of piecing together all of the events that transpired, I finally figured out what actually happened:

![What Actually Happened](/static/images/japan-retrospective/what-actually-happened.png)

Essentially, we never actually completed the Haruka trip by tapping out, but we never got charged for it either. Thankfully we weren't committing fare evasion of any kind, because our tickets *did* end up getting taken by the station attendant and we didn't get reimbursed.

After my dad managed to find a taxi pickup spot (and blundered even more by attempting to tip the driver, considered rude in Japan), we finally managed to arrive at our accommodation at 11pm. When we discussed the confusion with our receptionist, she checked the balance of our IC cards using an app (which we didn't even know was possible at the time) and discovered that we all still had our ¥500 balances. This was also the time where the "tap-in tap-out" system was explained to us——we were relieved, but we unfortunately were still unaware that our IC cards were still in a "trip" state since we failed to tap out, which would cause issues in the future.

We were all so relieved to finally be in our apartment, and ended up walking to a nearby 7-Eleven to grab some 12am dinner. And yes, the kombini is magical.

### Day 1: Osaka Day Trip

![Day 1](/static/images/japan-retrospective/day-1.png)

Although we were so exhausted from yesterday, we actually managed to wake up at around 5am due to jetlag (2am our time). We decided to take advantage of this and eat at a breakfast place two blocks down, recommended by our receptionist from yesterday. The summer sun was already out by 6am and we were welcomed with a nice walk:

![Day 1 Photo 1](/static/images/japan-retrospective/day-1-photo-1.png)

We ended up at a place called [やよい軒 四条烏丸店](https://tabelog.com/en/kyoto/A2601/A260201/26011748/) (Yayoi-ken Shijo-Karasuma, where Yayoi-ken is the chain name and Shijo-Karasuma is the branch name), a 24-hour chain restaurant that serves traditional Japanese [teishoku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teishoku) (set meals). It was pretty empty and even had a self-serve kiosk for ordering. Food was served quickly and was delicious; we had a lot of never-tried-before dishes like [natto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natt%C5%8D), and we enjoyed having so much variety of dishes for breakfast as we picked off of each other's plates to try everything:

<div className="flex gap-2">
![Day 1 Photo 2](/static/images/japan-retrospective/day-1-photo-2.png)

![Day 1 Photo 3](/static/images/japan-retrospective/day-1-photo-3.jpg)
</div>

Our first stop in our itinerary for today was [Osaka Castle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osaka_Castle), a very popular tourist attraction. Although I heard that Osaka Castle was underwhelming, I still wanted to go because we might as well see it if we're already there.

When we walked over to Karasuma Station with the intention of taking the Hankyu-Kyoto line down to Osaka, we were greeted by a prompt denial at the "tap-in" fare gate (remember how we were still in a "trip" state?). However, thank goodness for the station master who was able to clear up our messed up IC cards and let us re-tap in (for some reason he wasn't even bothered by the fact that we somehow tapped out of KIX and ended up in Kyoto without ever tapping out). We managed to get through the fare gate successfully!

After transferring to the Hankyu-Senri line at Awaji Station and doing one final transfer at Sakaisuji-Hommachi Station to the Chuo Line, we finally arrived at [Osaka Castle Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osaka_Castle_Park) at 9am opening time. The park was very peaceful, and the castle itself was quite grand:

![Day 1 Photo 4](/static/images/japan-retrospective/day-1-photo-4.png)

Although many people opt out of going inside the castle (it's just a museum and there is an entry fee), we decided to go in to get to the top floor and see views from the observation deck. The museum itself was very informative, and the view from the top was quite nice:

![Day 1 Photo 5](/static/images/japan-retrospective/day-1-photo-5.png)

Our next stop after this was [Shinsekai](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e4012.html), a business district in downtown Osaka which is known for its [Tsūtenkaku Tower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ts%C5%ABtenkaku), pretty signage and [kushikatsu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kushikatsu) (deep-fried skewers, Osaka's specialty):

![Day 1 Photo 8](/static/images/japan-retrospective/day-1-photo-8.jpg)

We had a lot of fun exploring the area and trying out some of the various street foods and stores, and we decided to have lunch at a kushikatsu place called [串かつとお出汁 串右衛門](https://tabelog.com/en/osaka/A2701/A270206/27135045/) (Kushikatsu Too Dashi Kushiemon) that we saw had a pretty exterior. Although the food was somewhat mediocre——it was simple fried skewers and other miscellaneous dishes——the service was wonderful because the person who staffed us was Vietnamese (a trend that would continue throughout the trip; there are a lot of Vietnamese people in Japan with work visas, and so we encountered more Vietnamese-speaking people than English-speaking people):

<div className="flex gap-2">
![Day 1 Photo 6](/static/images/japan-retrospective/day-1-photo-6.png)

![Day 1 Photo 7](/static/images/japan-retrospective/day-1-photo-7.jpg)
</div>

After shopping around a little bit (and even discovering a dead market alleyway), we decided to head to our next destination at around 1:30pm: [Nipponbashi's Den Den Town](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nipponbashi), Osaka's [Akihabara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akihabara) equivalent (electronics, otaku culture, collectibles). Den Den Town had a really interesting aesthetic: one insanely long street with huge signs flaring out from the buildings, with traffic lights down the entire road that turned red and green in unison. Although we didn't buy anything, we did peruse and enjoy the atmosphere:

<div className="flex gap-2">
![Day 1 Photo 9](/static/images/japan-retrospective/day-1-photo-9.jpg)

![Day 1 Photo 10](/static/images/japan-retrospective/day-1-photo-10.jpg)
</div>

Adjacently west of the Den Den Town street was the [Sennichimae Doguyasuji Shopping Street](https://osaka-info.jp/en/spot/sennichimae-doguyasuji-shopping-street/), a street known for its cute kitchenware and cookware stores. Here was where we took our first pit stop at a [Doutor](https://www.doutor.co.jp/en/) to grab some coffee and rest our feet.

Next stop was the [Kuromon Ichiba Market](https://www.osakastation.com/kuromon-ichiba-market/), a market known for its insanely fresh seafood and street food. We ended up getting a ¥1,000 stick of Wagyu beef, which was the first time we tried Japanese wagyu (pretty good!):

<div className="flex gap-2">
![Day 1 Photo 11](/static/images/japan-retrospective/day-1-photo-11.png)

![Day 1 Photo 12](/static/images/japan-retrospective/day-1-photo-12.jpg)
</div>

Although this was a brief "go through to get it over with" place, we did pass through [Hozenji Yokocho](https://insideosaka.com/hozenji-yokocho/) and [Hozenji Temple](https://www.japan.travel/en/spot/1109/), a small alleyway filled with pubs and izakayas with a temple at the end. This was a pretty touristy area due to it being recommended by some travel guides, but it was interesting seeing such a juxtaposition between the intensely modern Osaka area compared to the traditional alleyway and preserved temple:

![Day 1 Photo 13](/static/images/japan-retrospective/day-1-photo-13.jpg)

Our last stop of the day was [Dotonbori](https://www.osakastation.com/dotonbori-area-the-bright-heart-of-osaka/), a beautiful canal area filled with neon lights and billboards at the heart of Osaka. The canal was beautiful (and packed!) even in the daytime:

![Day 1 Photo 14](/static/images/japan-retrospective/day-1-photo-14.jpg)

Besides the main canal area, there is so much to see and do around the Dotonbori area. Nearby was the [Ebisubashi-suji Shopping Street](https://osaka-info.jp/en/spot/ebisubashisuji-shopping-street/), where we ended up buying new shoes for my little brother (who had demolished his current pair by intense walking and heat):

<div className="flex gap-2">
![Day 1 Photo 15](/static/images/japan-retrospective/day-1-photo-15.jpg)

![Day 1 Photo 16](/static/images/japan-retrospective/day-1-photo-16.jpg)
</div>

Dinner was, of course, at the famous [Ichiran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ichiran) ramen chain. Many people love to hate on tourists dining at Ichiran because it's an "overrated chain", but we genuinely enjoyed the experience they catered to us. We got in line at around 4:30pm and paid for our meals via vending machine tickets, and were also provided a pencil and small sheet of paper to customize how we wanted our ramen (noodle firmness, broth richness, spice level, etc). We were seated in individual booths in a little over an hour and were served with zero interaction with the staff:

![Day 1 Photo 17](/static/images/japan-retrospective/day-1-photo-17.jpg)

The ramen itself was really palatable (especially for my parents and little brother, who weren't as fond of heavy/oily flavors as much as I was), and the experience was quite unique. Even for an insanely popular chain, their quality of service and food was still top-notch.

After dinner, we walked off our meal by exploring and shopping around Dotonbori. Although I wanted to wait to take pictures of the canal during the night, we were all pretty burnt out and decided to head back to Kyoto at around 7:30pm.

### Day 2: Nara Day Trip
