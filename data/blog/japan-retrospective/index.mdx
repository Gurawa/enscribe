### Intro

This is going to be a little different from the posts I typically make on this site!

During my senior year of high school, I (17M at the time) was given the behemoth task of planning a trip to Japan for my immediate family of four. The idea was my Mom's——I was given absolutely nothing to work with, except for the general time interval which was feasible (the summer of 2023) alongside the guttural desire to go. Although I happily obliged——I was the most "knowledgeable" about internet research and Japanese culture——I quickly realized that being the one to plan came with both responsibilities and accountability. I would be the one to:

- Plan the entire itinerary, from start to finish (which stipulated deciding on the cities we'd visit, the attractions we'd see, and the general pathing between them)
- Book all flights, accommodations (hotels, ryokans/inns, etc.), and transportation (shinkansen/bullet trains, buses, subways, etc.)
- Be the primary navigator, a.k.a. figuring out how the public transportation system works as a suburban Angeleno who had never taken a bus (let alone the subway) in his life

Although I was blatantly overwhelmed, the overall excitement which came with the idea of the trip itself was enough to keep me going. For the next few months, I spent many days and nights dealing with the planning process, and I can say with confidence that it was one of the most rewarding experiences of my life. I'd like to share some of the highlights, blunders, and experiences I gathered throughout the process.

### Fundamentals!

Before getting into the nitty-gritty of the itinerary and planning process, I'll cover some of the fundamental aspects of traveling to Japan, as a prerequisite knowledge floor for terminology, cities, and transportation absolutely exists. Of course, I'll assume that you know of the country's existence alongside its general culture:

1. Japan has a bullet train system called the Shinkansen, which connects many of its major cities together at insanely high speeds. The Shinkansen, alongside many other trains, are owned by a central authority called the Japan Railways Group (JR). Although you could purchase one-way tickets for JR-owned rail, if you take the Shinkansen a lot it's recommended you purchase a JR Pass, which allows unlimited, economic travel on JR rail (e.g. Shinkansen) for the duration of the pass (offered in 7, 14, and 21-day varieties).
2. Within metropolitan areas, you can use rechargeable public transportation cards called IC Cards (e.g. Suica/Pasmo in Tokyo, Icoca in the Kansai region, and Kitaca in Hokkaido) to use subways, buses, and even purchase items at convenience stores.

### The Itinerary

Itinerary-making for a destination like Japan would be described as, at best, a clusterfuck. The moment you Googled "2-week japan itinerary" you get back a bunch of self-proclaimed travel warlords who sell you surface-level bullet points and mediocre locations. You can see for yourself how plans can change drastically over time; I kept a Google Doc throughout the entire process:

Amidst all of this noise, I found a couple of credible and consistent sources which, although were still overwhelming, provided some semblance of "I know what I'm doing, I'm not going to be a stupid tourist." Those were:

- [japan-guide.com](https://www.japan-guide.com/): Seriously phenomenal itineraries. A lot of my day trips and main destinations were suggested by this site!
- [r/JapanTravel](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/): I read through dozens of "Itinerary Check" (a user sends in their itinerary, and it gets reviewed by others to see what's feasible, things to change, recommendations, etc.) and "Trip Report" (a user sends in their specific experiences and recommendations) posts. Although you still have to use some internet fluency to discern what's good advice and what's not, I found some lovely ideas here, and decided to add them to our own itinerary based on vibes and family preferences.
- Friends! Please ask people who've been (or who live there) for recommendations. I ended up skipping some of the places shilled by the internet because of personal anecdotes from friends.

Since the itinerary-making process was super iterative and went through multiple revisions, I'll only be showing the final product here. This was the final pathing that we decided on:

Although the lines themselves are slightly for show (they're the colors used for transit lines and should be ignored for now), each roman numeral here represents a particular city. We can create a calendar to see how the days were designated across these cities:

A lot of thought was put into this particular order and spacing, but I'll only provide a high-level overview here for brevity's sake:

- Lodging in Kyoto immediately while taking day trips to Osaka and Nara would be both economical and limit the amount of times we'd have to change accommodations. Kyoto is also the most culturally immersive, which I thought would be the best for my family in comparison to Tokyo (they like "chill" environments).
- No backtracking! A lot of itineraries make you land at Haneda Airport in Tokyo, go west towards Kyoto, Hiroshima, Nagoya, etc. and then make you wrap all the way back. That's a lot of Shinkansen money (forcing you to buy JR passes) and luggage lugging, and my routing only makes you take the shinkansen once.
- Hakone is known for its ryokans——traditional inns with hot springs/onsen——which is a relaxing segue between the insane juxtapositions of Kyoto and Tokyo. I chose to do two nights here so that we could take the entire Hakone loop whilst enjoying the in-room dinner services that ryokans provide.
- Saving Tokyo for last prevents burnout; it's a fast-paced, endless metropolis with many venues for shopping and exploration. Since we'd be buying the most things in Tokyo (courtesy of the weak JPY) we could just box it up and check it out at the airport.
